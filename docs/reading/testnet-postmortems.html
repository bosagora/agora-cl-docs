eth2 with our Agora-cl project, we are tasked with maintaining a high integrity cloud deployment that runs several nodes in our testnet. Additionally, we are always on call to determine problems which arise in the network and must be addressed by the team. This page outlines a collection of incident reports and their resolutions from catastrophic events in our testnet. We hope it will shed more light on our devops process and how we tackle the hard problems managing a distributed system such as eth2 entails.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="not-receiving-p2p-blocks-incident-7"></a>Not Receiving P2P Blocks (Incident #7)<a class="hash-link" href="#not-receiving-p2p-blocks-incident-7" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><strong>Date:</strong> 2020/04/18</p><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Preston, Raul</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> Root cause identified, resolved</p><p><strong>Network:</strong> Topaz</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Beacon nodes were not receiving blocks via gossipsub p2p at all, making it impossible to keep up with the chain head after initial sync completes.</p><p><strong>Reference issues:</strong>

The span in Jaeger, supports this theory as it shows OnAttestation taking nearly 1s with the large majority being taken up by writing attestation data to disk. Initially it looked like an improper use of Batch Updates in Bolt.</li><li>1:10 After exploring the code in some more, Nishant finds the problem is not that but instead the fact that the function upateAttVotes is very heavy on disk I/O due to the latest vote being saved for each validator in the attestation. This coupled with the fact that the Agora node receives 200 attestations/sec , it would explain the large amounts of time being spent on db writes in Jaeger.</li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="supporting-information-1"></a>Supporting information<a class="hash-link" href="#supporting-information-1" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Statefulset prod pods being stuck even after a rollout of a previous image was completed - pods showed no error logs but after finishing regular sync, they were unhealthy and were unable to serve traffic to validators.

Finality alert notified on call and response time was less than a minute.</p><p><strong>What went wrong</strong></p><ul><li>There are multiple issues causing finality gap and it was hard to isolate the problem.</li><li>We allowed too many external peers to join the testnet and go offline. At the time of the event, we only controlled 70% of active validators which is dangerously close to falling under 2/3rds majority. Given the ephemeral nature of external testers, we can assume that the majority of validators not controlled by Prysmatic Labs are offline. Any issue in the network is extra sensitive to finality gaps.</li><li>There is an existing bug where non-canonical blocks are served on p2p RPC requests for blocks by range. This is blocking testnet users from syncing to head and is blocking normal rollout procedures for beacon-chain-prod-1.</li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="where-we-got-lucky-5"></a>Where we got lucky<a class="hash-link" href="#where-we-got-lucky-5" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li>Some validators were close to ejection. After enough of the exponential penalties, the network was able to reach finality.
