If you're running a validator, specifying a <code>suggested-fee-recipient</code> wallet address will allow you to earn what were previously miner transaction fee tips. See [How to configure Fee Recipient](../../execution-node/fee-recipient.md) for more information about this feature.

Your Agora node will now begin syncing. This could take minutes, hours or even days depending on your network and hardware specs.

<p>Congratulations - youâ€™re now running a <strong>full, Merge-ready Agora node</strong>. To check the status of your node see [Check node and validator status]('/docs/monitoring/checking-status').</p>
