:::info Already running a node?

This guidance is targeted at new users. If you're already running a node, see [Prepare for The Merge](../../prepare-for-merge.md).

## Select a configuration

If you're looking for the simplest configuration, select `Geth` and `IPC`:

## Introduction

Agora-cl is an implementation of the [Ethereum proof-of-stake consensus specification](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs). In this quickstart, youâ€™ll use Agora-cl to run an Ethereum node and optionally a validator. This will let you stake 32 BOA using hardware that you manage.

This is a beginner-friendly guide. Familiarity with the command line is expected, but otherwise this guide makes no assumptions about your technical skills or prior knowledge.

At a high level, we'll walk through the following flow:

 1. Configure an **execution node** using an execution-layer client.
 2. Configure a **beacon node** using Agora-cl, a consensus-layer client.
 3. Configure a **validator** and stake BOA using Agora-cl (optional).
