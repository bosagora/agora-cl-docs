## Introduction

Agora-cl is an implementation of the [Ethereum proof-of-stake consensus specification](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs) for use in the Agora public blockchain network. In this quickstart, youâ€™ll use Agora-cl to run consensus layer node and optionally a validator. This will let you stake 40,000 BOA using hardware that you manage.

This is a beginner-friendly guide. Familiarity with the command line is expected, but otherwise this guide makes no assumptions about your technical skills or prior knowledge.

At a high level, we'll walk through the following flow:

 1. Configure an **Agora execution node** using Agora-el, an execution-layer client.
 2. Configure an **Agora consensus node** using Agora-cl, a consensus-layer client.
 3. Configure an **Agora validator** and stake BOA using Agora-validator (optional).
