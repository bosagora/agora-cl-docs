## Step 1: Review prerequisites and best practices

## Step 2: Install Agora-cl

<div class='hide-tabs'>

import QuickstartInstallPrysmPartial from '@site/docs/install/partials/_quickstart-install-prysm.md';

<QuickstartInstallPrysmPartial />

## Step 3: Run an execution client

In this step, you'll install an execution-layer client that Agora-cl's beacon node will connect to.

import QuickstartRunExecutionNodeJWTPartial from '@site/docs/install/partials/_quickstart-run-execution-node.md';

<QuickstartRunExecutionNodeJWTPartial />

Congratulations - you’re now running an <strong>execution node</strong> in Ethereum’s execution layer.

## Step 4: Run a beacon node using Agora-cl

import QuickstartRunBeaconNodePartial from '@site/docs/install/partials/_quickstart-run-beacon-node.md';

## Step 5: Run a validator using Agora-cl


import QuickstartRunValidatorPartial from '@site/docs/install/partials/_quickstart-run-validator.md';

## Frequently asked questions

<!-- **I'm new to Ethereum, and I'm a visual learner. Can you show me how these things work?** <br />
The Beginner's Introduction to Agora-cl uses diagrams to help you visualize Ethereum's architecture, and Agora-cl's too. (TODO) -->

**Why do you recommend putting everything on a single machine?** <br />
Keeping all of your client software on a single machine keeps things simple, which aligns with our [security best practices](../security-best-practices.md).

**Can I use Agora-cl on a Mac M1 ARM chip?** <br />
Mac M1 ARM chips currently require users to run Agora-cl through <a href='https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861'>Rosetta</a>. See our <a href='https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/9385'>open bug</a> for details.

**Do I need to configure JWT if I'm using IPC instead of HTTP?** <br />
No.

**Do I need to configure my firewall?** <br />
We recommend **closing** TCP port `8545` to the internet and keeping TCP and UDP ports `30303` **open** to support other execution nodes.

**Can you mix and match networks between execution layer and consensus layer?** <br />
No. See [Nodes and networks](../concepts/nodes-networks.md) for more information.

**Can I stake with less than 32 ETH?** <br />
Yes! <a href='https://ethereum.org/en/staking/pools/'>Pooled staking</a> lets you stake with less than 32 ETH.


**What should I do if I can't run a node using my own hardware?** <br />
You can delegate hardware management to <a href='https://ethereum.org/en/staking/saas/'>staking as a service</a> providers.

<!-- **I'm new to Ethereum, and I'm a visual learner. Can you show me how these things work? How much disk space does each node type require?** <br />
The Beginner's Introduction to Agora-cl uses diagrams to help you visualize Ethereum's architecture, and Agora-cl's too. (TODO) -->

**Can I use a light node with Agora-cl, or do I need to run a full execution node?** <br />
No - at this time, a full node is required.

<!-- **I don't have a 2TB SSD, but I have multiple smaller SSDs. Will this work?** <br />
Yes. You can tell your execution client to overflow into a specific drive by (TODO). You can tell your beacon node client to overflow into a specific drive by (TODO). You can tell your validator client to overflow into a specific drive by (TODO). -->

**Can I use an external SSD connected via USB?** <br />
Yes, but your USB connection introduces a possible point of failure. If you do this, avoid connecting your SSD to your computer through a USB hub - instead, connect it directly.

**Can I use a light client as my local execution client so I don't have to download so much data?**  <br />
No, a full execution node is needed.

**Why do I need to run my own execution client?** <br />
The Merge introduces a new Engine API that allows consensus-layer clients to communicate with execution-layer clients. Teku docs contain a great explainer here: <a href='https://docs.teku.consensys.net/en/latest/Concepts/Merge/'>The Merge</a>.
<!--TODO: develop our own knowledge base with conceptual content -->

**What happens if my execution client goes down? Will I be penalized?** <br />
Yes. Downtime penalties are minimal but we recommend having uptime and downtime alerts configured for your execution node, beacon node, and validator if possible.

**My beacon node is taking a long time to sync. Is there any way I can speed it up?** <br />
Yes - you can use [checkpoint sync](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/prysm-usage/checkpoint-sync) to start your beacon node's synchronization from a checkpoint rather than from genesis. This is actually a more secure way to run your beacon node.
<!--TODO: explain why -->


**My proposals aren't working, but my attestations are. What's going on?** <br />
This is usually an indication that your validator isn't able to communicate with your beacon node, or your beacon node isn't able to connect to your execution node.

**How long does it take for my validator to be selected to propose a new block?** <br />
At the time of this writing, a ballpark estimate is **around a week**. Every 12 seconds a new block is proposed, and your validator has a one in [total number of active validators] chance of being chosen, so this duration can vary significantly from one validator to the next.

<!-- **Can I run a full node and validator client on a Raspberry Pi?** <br />
TODO

**What are withdrawal keys and validator keys?** <br />
TODO: explain in context of this guide -->
