Validators should be online as much as possible. If you're running your validator on a cloud server, or if you want your validator to automatically start running when the host machine restarts, consider running your client software as a background service through either Docker or systemd.

:::caution

This may be overkill for at-home stakers who use the `prysm.sh` script to run Agora-cl. To those users, we recommend **keeping it simple** by occasionally checking the status of your validator. See [Check Software Status](../monitoring/checking-status) to learn more.

:::

### Docker

You can use Docker to run your beacon node and validators as background services. See [Install with Docker](../install/install-with-docker). You can monitor and view your running Docker containers using `docker ps`.

### Systemd (Linux)

Linux systems allow for easy running of services in the background through a daemon process called [systemd](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/systemd-essentials-working-with-services-units-and-the-journal). You can follow the tutorial posted by [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/systemd-essentials-working-with-services-units-and-the-journal) on setting up systemd services.

You can run your beacon node with the following systemd configuration, where you can modify some of the fields and flags to your liking. Assuming your prysm.sh script is at `/home/prysm/prysm.sh`.

```text
[Unit]
Description=Agora-cl Beacon chain daemon
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/prysm/prysm.sh beacon-chain
Restart=on-failure
User=YOUR_USER

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

You can also run your validator client in systemd using the following configuration.

```text
[Unit]
Description=Agora-cl Validator daemon
After=network-online.target
Wants=prysm-beacon.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/prysm/prysm.sh validator --wallet-dir DIR/TO/prysm-wallet-v2 --wallet-password-file DIR/TO/YOUR_PASSWORDFILE --graffiti YOUR_GRAFFITI
Restart=on-failure
User=YOUR_USER

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```
